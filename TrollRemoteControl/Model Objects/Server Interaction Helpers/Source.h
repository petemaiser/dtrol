//  A source represents a source on the processor or receiver; it is a wrapper to a Command to switch to that source.
//  As a wrapper it includes a display name for the source, provides the value for this particular source, and
//  determines if the source is enabled or not in this app

// The Source Object, along with the other server interaction helper objects, will send the commands so the view controllers do not
// need to have any awareness of how a source-command works, they can just call it.  The Prefix abstraction enables a prefix to be added to the,
// entire command, with would typically be a reference to a zone.
