//  This class exists to enable "Local" type tuner preset control where we will build "Tuner Station" present capability
//  into this app.  The reason this craziness exists is for Anthem AVM style tuner control where preset seek is not supported.
//  This occurs on pre-MRX Anthem components, i.e. AVM less than "60" plus D1 and D2 variants.
